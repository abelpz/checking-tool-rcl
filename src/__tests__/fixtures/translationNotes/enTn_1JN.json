In the context of the whole letter, by **a sin toward death**, John is probably referring to behavior such as the false teachers engaged in and encouraged. As Part 3 of the Introduction to 1 John explains, these false teachers claimed that it did not matter what people did in their bodies, and so they would have been committing many serious sins without feeling any conviction that their actions were wrong. This showed that they had abandoned faith in Jesus and had rejected the influence of the Holy Spirit. John implicitly corrects this false teaching again in [5:18](rc://en/ult/book/1jn/05/18). Here John is not telling the believers not to pray for some people. Rather, he is explaining that it will not do any good to pray for them since they are determined to live in a way that is contrary to faith in Jesus and the influence of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “There are people (such as the false teachers) who are sinning in a way that shows that they have decided to be separated from God for eternity. Praying for them is not likely to make any difference”",

In that case, John is addressing the believers in three different groups in verses 12–14, and this group would represent new believers, that is, those who have very recently put their faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins.

The **blood** represents Jesus’ death on the cross, when he shed his blood as the Savior of the world. The **water** could stand for: (1) Jesus’ baptism. When John baptized Jesus in the water of the Jordan River, the Son of God began his ministry of reconciling the world to God. See the UST. (2) Jesus’ birth. There was the breaking of the birth water when the Son of God was born as a man.

This letter is an exception, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply John’s name here, as UST does. As noted above, John uses the plural pronoun “we” because he is speaking on behalf of himself and the other eyewitnesses to Jesus’ earthly life. But it may be more natural in your language for him to refer to himself with a singular pronoun, and if so, you could also do that in your translation, as in the UST.
